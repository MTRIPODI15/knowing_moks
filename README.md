# 🧪 MockedTests Multilanguage – Automated Testing Project with Mocks

## 🎯 Project Goal

Use mocks in different programming languages to practice or understand how tests are designed and executed in agile methodologies, especially when the fixture or backend development is not yet available during a sprint.

This project simulates flows such as bank transfers, user login, and client registration, using controlled (mocked) responses to validate behavior, error handling, and business logic.

#  Technologies and Tools
This project includes examples in the following languages and environments:

| Language / Tool        | Testing Framework     | Mocking Tool / Technique       |
|------------------------|------------------------|--------------------------------|
| 🐍 Python              | `pytest`               | `responses`, `requests-mock`   |
| 🟨 JavaScript / Node   | `jest`, `msw`          | `msw`, `nock`                  |
| ☕ Java                | `JUnit`, `RestAssured` | `WireMock`, `Mockito`          |
| 📮 Postman            | Collections + Newman   | Built-in Mock Server           |

# 📁 Each module includes:

- Source code  
- Flow diagram of the simulated case  
- Evidence (logs, screenshots)  
- Specific README with execution instructions
